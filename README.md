# Expanding the Capabilities Of My Mind

## The idea

Thanks to the work of my lovely wife, I have recieved various reports of my cognitive deficiencies and strengths. Because of my poor short term memory and planning skills, I often miss opportunities. I've decided to build an aid to address these issues digitally. Computers are excellent at storing, recalling and scheduling information. SteelTrap is part calendar, part project management, part personal assistant, part alligator, part shark, and part amazing.
